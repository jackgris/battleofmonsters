# Example of exercise for a job interview.

This exercise uses the Ginkgo library for testing if you want to run one specific test. You could do that using the name of the test like this:

```bash
ginkgo -v --focus "MonsterController" ./app/tests/controller/...
```

Where `MonsterController` is the name of the test that you want to run, and in this case, the command is run in the root folder of the project.
